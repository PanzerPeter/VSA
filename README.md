# Vertical Slice Architecture Guidelines

This repository contains a structured XML specification that documents the **Vertical Slice Architecture** pattern in detail. It is designed to serve as a reference for architects, developers, and engineering teams adopting a feature-oriented approach to software design.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)** promotes organizing code by **features** rather than by technical layers (like controllers, services, or repositories). This model enhances modularity, testability, and team scalability by aligning software structure with business capabilities.

The XML file includes:
- Formal definitions of vertical slice principles
- Comparisons to layered architectures
- Documented benefits and drawbacks
- Guidelines for cross-cutting concerns
- Refactoring triggers and best practices
- Framework-specific recommendations (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python, Java)
- Suitability matrix by application type
- Integration with related architectural patterns

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

- [`vertical_slice_guidelines.xml`](./vertical_slice_guidelines.xml): Main specification file describing the architecture in XML format.

## âœ… Key Highlights

- **Self-contained feature slices** that isolate business logic
- **Improved change isolation**, enabling safer refactors
- **Better alignment with Agile**, CQRS, and event-driven systems
- **Framework-agnostic structure** with concrete examples for popular ecosystems

## ðŸ”§ Intended Use

- Software architecture documentation
- Code review and refactoring reference
- Onboarding for teams transitioning to vertical slicing
- Template for architecture governance and standardization

## ðŸ§© Supported Frameworks

The XML document includes example patterns for:
- **.NET (MediatR, feature folders)**
- **Node.js (Express)**
- **Python (FastAPI)**
- **Java (Spring)**
